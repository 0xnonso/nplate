A **Simple**, **Minimalist** Template for Noir Projects.

## Getting Started

Click [`use this template`](https://github.com/whitenois3/nplate/generate) to create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Development

**Setup**

You need both `nargo` and `foundry` installed.

Regarding the installation of `nargo`, please refer to its repo [here](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir).

**Building**

```bash
cd circuits
# executes the circuit
nargo execute
# generates a file "proof" in circuits/target/proof
bb prove -b ./target/nplate.json -w ./target/nplate.gz -o ./target/proof
# generates the solidity verifier contract
bb contract/ultra_plonk_vk.sol
# verify the circuit and compute its verification key
bb write_vk -b ./target/nplate.json -o ./target/vk
bb verify -k ./target/vk -p ./target/proof
```

**Testing**

Before testing, be sure you have generated the updated Solidity verifier contract!

```bash
forge test
```
